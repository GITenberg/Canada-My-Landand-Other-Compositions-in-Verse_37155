&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a faithful Scottish minister,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the olden time.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And when, amid his elders grave,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended in a line<BR>
Beside the table of the Lord,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the rite divine,<BR>
His face with a rapt, unearthly look<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seen to strangely shine,<BR>
As he broke the white, symbolic bread,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed the sacred wine:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a saintly Scottish minister,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the olden time.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
His lot was hard, his task severe;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found the burden light:<BR>
When darkly o'er his pathway hung<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of the night,<BR>
His heart was steadfast, for he walked<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By faith, and not by sight;<BR>
And ran triumphantly his course,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fought a goodly fight:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a brave old Scottish minister,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the olden time.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And when upon a summer's day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laid him down to die,<BR>
He called his household to his side<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a moan or sigh,<BR>
And blessed his children each in turn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said a fond good-bye,<BR>
And then consigned his soul to God,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went to live on high:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a good old Scottish minister,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the olden time.<BR>

THE MACS.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
There's a race, or a part of a race, if you will,<BR>
Of renown prehistoric, and vigorous still,<BR>
Who back from their fastnesses scornfully hurl'd<BR>
The redoubtable legions that trampled the world;<BR>
They repelled, and they only, the Roman attacks,<BR>
The stalwart, courageous, impetuous Macs.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the red-bearded pirates, the Saxons and Danes<BR>
And Angles, came swarming across the sea plains,<BR>
And the old British stock to exterminate tried,<BR>
Caledonia and Erin their efforts defied;<BR>
And the conquering Normans were glad to make tracks<BR>
From the Macs and the Mics (who are properly Macs).<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Their proud patronymics, they rightfully hold,<BR>
Proclaim them descended from heroes of old.&mdash;<BR>
Illustrious titles that throw in the shade<BR>
The dukedoms and earldoms but yesterday made;<BR>
And even the King with his royalty lacks<BR>
A lineage as ancient as that of the Macs.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They are old and yet young, with a spirit possest<BR>
By the dream of the East and the hope of the West;<BR>
The earth is their country, the race is their kin;<BR>
In populous cities their guerdon they win,<BR>
And in gold miners' cabins and lumbermen's shacks<BR>
You will find the ubiquitous, venturesome Macs.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Distinguished they've been with the sword and the pen;<BR>
In pulpit and parliament, leaders of men;<BR>
Prime ministers, presidents, merchants, viziers,<BR>
They have manag'd the business of both hemispheres;<BR>
And the Dago day-laborers laying the tracks<BR>
Are boss'd by the Macs or the Mics (who are Macs).<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'Twas thought by the ancients that Atlas upbore<BR>
The sphere on his shoulders&mdash;'tis thought so no more;<BR>
Prometheus and Atlas and all of their kith,<BR>
The Titans, are now but a fable, a myth.<BR>
The men who are bearing the world on their backs<BR>
Are the Macs and the Mics (who are mixed with the Macs).<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
It's very disagreeable to sit here in the cold,<BR>
And a sinful waste of time&mdash;ah, well, it's too late now to scold;<BR>
I'll think about my sermon and my prayers for Sunday next,<BR>
And the young folks may be happy&mdash;let me see&mdash;what was my text?<BR>
But what a throng of people&mdash;an immortal soul in each:<BR>
With such an audience this would be a splendid place to preach.<BR>
I'd have the pulpit half-way down&mdash;what ice! without a smirch!<BR>
Here are the men&mdash;I wonder if they ever go to church.<BR>
"The teams?"  Ah, yes, "the forwards, point, and cover-point and goal";<BR>
Thank you, my dear, I understand&mdash;is that a lump of coal?<BR>
"Rubber?"  Ah, yes, "The puck?" just so!  One's holding it, I see&mdash;<BR>
That fellow with his clothes all on&mdash;ah, that's the referee.<BR>
What was he whistling for&mdash;his dog?  Why, they've begun to play;<BR>
Well, well, that's rough; I really think we're doing wrong to stay.<BR>
It's sickening, deafening; dear!  I wish this uproar could be stilled.<BR>
I do sincerely trust there'll not be anybody killed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It's a wondrous exhibition of alertness, speed, and strength.<BR>
I suppose there's not much danger&mdash;there's a fellow at full length.<BR>
He's up again; that's plucky.  Well, the little lad has pluck&mdash;<BR>
And now he's master of the ice, possessor of the puck.<BR>
He dodges two opponents, but collides with one at last,<BR>
A Philistine Goliath&mdash;David baffles him and fast<BR>
Darts onward o'er the whitening sheet, while from each crowded row<BR>
The crazed spectators cheer him on&mdash;Look!&mdash;has he lost it?  No!<BR>
He's clear again.  Played, played, my boy.  I'd like to see him score:&mdash;<BR>
(I'll have no voice for Sunday if I shout like this much more)&mdash;<BR>
But there his ruthless enemies o'erwhelm him in a shoal&mdash;<BR>
Well played, you hero, safely passed.  Now for a shot on goal.<BR>
Shoot, shoot, you duffer; shoot, you goose, you ass, you great galoot,<BR>
You addle-pated idiot, you nincompoop, you&mdash;shoot!<BR>
You've lost it!  Never mind&mdash;well tried&mdash;that other dash was grand.<BR>
Why do they stop?  "Off side," you say?  I don't quite understand.<BR>
That's puzzling.  I suppose it's right.  I wish they'd not delay.<BR>
This is a most provoking interruption to the play.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Cold?"  Nothing of the sort.  I was&mdash;I'm heated with the game.<BR>
I'm really enjoying it; indeed, I'm glad I came.<BR>
I'd like to see both ends at once; I can't from where we sit.<BR>
They've scored one yonder&mdash;What's the row?  A player has been hit?<BR>
Such things are bound to happen in a rapid game like this;<BR>
They'll soon resume the play, my dear; there's nothing much amiss,&mdash;<BR>
Some trifling accident received in a rough body check,<BR>
A shoulder dislocated or a fracture of the neck.<BR>
Oh, no, it's nothing serious&mdash;the game begins again.<BR>
They're here, a writhing, struggling mass of half a dozen men<BR>
Battling and groaning with the strife, and breathing hard and fast,<BR>
Swayed back and forth and stooping low like elms before the blast,<BR>
Changing their places like a fleet of vessels tempest-driven<BR>
That blindly meet within the waves and part with timbers riven,<BR>
Waving their sticks with frantic zeal&mdash;But isn't this a sight?<BR>
My goodness!  I could sit and watch a game like this all night.<BR>
There, dirty trousers, there's your chance.  Muffed it!  Why weren't<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you quick?<BR>
This is a sight to make the sad rejoice, to heal the sick,<BR>
To rouse the drones and give them life to last them half a year&mdash;<BR>
Hit him again!&mdash;I wish I had my congregation here.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My stars! and this is hockey.  Hockey's the king of sports.<BR>
This is the thing to come to when you're feeling out of sorts.<BR>
This is the greatest holiday I've had for many weeks.<BR>
This helps one to appreciate the feeling of the Greeks.<BR>
I understand my Homer now&mdash;O Hercules, behold<BR>
Yon Trojan giant, he that's cast in an Olympian mould,<BR>
Ye gods, he more than doubled up that other stalwart cove&mdash;<BR>
Here comes swift-footed Mercury, the messenger of Jove.<BR>
Adown the blue, outstripping all, he speeds.  Oh, what a spurt!<BR>
His shoulders have no wings, but see, he has them on his shirt.<BR>
He's broken through the forward line, baffled the cover-point,<BR>
Thrown down the other man and knocked their game all out of joint.<BR>
And now he rushes on the goal&mdash;this makes the senses reel&mdash;<BR>
Goal! goal! hurrah! hurrah! well done, men of the winged wheel!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last&mdash;how soon!&mdash;the game is done; I've scarcely drawn a breath.<BR>
This getting out is difficult; I'm almost crushed to death.<BR>
The cars are packed; how we'll get home I'm sure I do not know.<BR>
Here's room for you; get up, my dears; I'll walk; away you go.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My sermon's gone, but as I walk I cannot help but think<BR>
That, after all, perhaps I've found a sermon in the rink.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
This world is an arena with a slippery sheet of ice,<BR>
And all have skates and hockey sticks and enter without price.<BR>
And seats are round for those who rest&mdash;the idle and the old;<BR>
But those who are not in the game are apt to find it cold.<BR>
Some play defence, some forward, with terrific speed and stress.<BR>
The puck keeps flying 'twixt the goals of failure and success,<BR>
Now up, now down, across and back, here, there, and everywhere.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The grit of skates, the crack of sticks, the shouting, fill the air.<BR>
Some slip and fall a thousand times and spring up in a trice;<BR>
Some go to pieces on their feet and have to leave the ice;<BR>
Some play offside, kick, tackle, trip, try every kind of foul;<BR>
Some players are forever cheered, some only get a howl.<BR>
We seldom hear the whistle of the watchful Referee,<BR>
Who mostly lets the game go on as if He didn't see.<BR>
No gong rings out half-time to let the players get their breath&mdash;<BR>
To most full time comes only with the solemn stroke of death.<BR>
The winners are not always those who make the biggest score:<BR>
The vanquished oft are victors when the stubborn game is o'er;<BR>
For many things are added to make up the grand amount,<BR>
And everything is taken at the last into account&mdash;<BR>
The sort of sticks we played with, and the way our feet were shod,<BR>
For the trophy is Salvation and the Referee is God.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
God prosper our Canadian sports and keep them clean and pure,<BR>
Whole-hearted, manly, generous, and let them long endure!<BR>
Long live each honest winter sport, each good Canadian game,<BR>
To train the youth in lusty health and iron strength of frame,<BR>
To make them noble, vigorous, straightforward, ardent, bold,<BR>
Nearer a perfect standard than the grandest knights of old.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Keep in the path of rectitude the young throughout the land,<BR>
And guide them ever on their way by thine unerring hand,<BR>
Along the slippery path of life in safety toward the goal,<BR>
And keep their bodies holy as the temples of the soul:<BR>
For the river of the future from the present's fountain runs,<BR>
And a nation's hope is founded on the virtue of her sons.<BR>

The glory of a man is strength, Thy wisdom hath declared:<BR>
Let strength increase, and strength of frame with strength of will<BR>

And let these twain go hand in hand with strength of heart and mind,<BR>

Oh, make out strength the strength of men to perfect stature grown,<BR>
And use it for thine ends and turn man's glory to thine own.<BR>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
